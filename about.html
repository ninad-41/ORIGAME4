                    This website is dedicated to my friend, Honey. Honey has an origami studio.
                    He always wanted to show this creativity online. So he decided to make 
                    a website of his own and asked me to help. Here he wishes to explain 
                    step-by-step how origami is made. I hope you all enjoy making the origami.
